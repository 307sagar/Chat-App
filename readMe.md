# Import the project in any IDE.
# Random avatar is implemented from the sample mock api. as mentioned below.
# Implemented onlick on the avatar tile. Onclick. it will display the chat window.
# Search is working as expected. Not making excess calls or redeundant searches.
# Autoexpansion of messages view is implemented. Needs some work to maintain display of consistent chat data when long sentences are fed to the chat contents to display.
# For actual messages hard coded chat messages is implemented. For e.g when a user types something, it will display as a real time chat service.
# I have created the mock api to fetch sample data and here is the url:
https://run.mocky.io/v3/ea4ed786-7f3b-4882-b678-255c1791c2d8
Please let me know if you are unable to access the url.

# The one way chat implementation is completed but the state is not retained. So, with every refresh the data of the chat is lost. I had worked on implementing if submission was not quite close.

# Hope to have a good review remarks on the same. Thank you!!!
